## Data Pipeline

Upload the zip file containing the images to the google drive 

1. [Unzip to Google Drive](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16MA1rnpI68qGQ4sxjjwH7ATVzfAP6hqo?usp=sharing)
2. [Extract Classification catagories and Images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16MA1rnpI68qGQ4sxjjwH7ATVzfAP6hqo?usp=sharing)
3. [Extract the Dresses using U2NET](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vicx8g2hgyF7Lr1I-6luwy3dBelu8ElC?usp=sharing)
4. [FFMPEG to fit resolution](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J2IX44MNzatyDqbI-e4jF3UXay8wl7S3?usp=sharing)

#### Pipeline Flow 

1. Upload the zip file containing the images that will be feed to styleGAN and stable diffusion
2. Run the zip google worksheet to extract the unzip the files   
3. Now we need to get the catagories that are we can get from the data, so run extract Classification google sheet
4. Now we the data that is divided into catagories, but we need to extract the dress so run the U2NET sheet
5. Ok, we have the dresses extracted now, but the resolution is not correct, so run FFMPEG to fix this 
6. Now, the data is ready to be run on styleGAN and stable diffusion
